This folder can be published **for free** with GitHub Pages. It hosts your **Student Hub** (video + handouts + quiz button) and the **self‑grading quiz**.

## Files

- `quiz.html` — Self‑grading quiz (70% pass → feedback form)
- (optional) add PDFs alongside these files and link them from `index.html`
